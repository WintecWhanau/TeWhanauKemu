Maui: There Tumatauenga, I have beaten your most skilled fighters!
Tumatauenga: Maui... I have seen with my own eyes, that you are indeed a great warrior.  Your journey here can't have been easy, so I grant you the gift of resilience. 
With this gift, you will not be weakened by your enemies so easily. Surely an advantage when you face Tama-nui-te-ra!
Maui: Thank you Tumatauenga. With all the gifts of the Atua combined, I now feel ready to fight and defeat Tama-nui-te-ra
