Tangaroa: Aue Maui! I did not realise you were so skilled. You have earned my respect and I shall grant you with the gift of speed and agility, as you will surely need them both to defeat Tama-nui-te-ra!
Maui: Thank you Tangaroa. I will take your gifts and learn to master them before facing Tamanui-te-ra
