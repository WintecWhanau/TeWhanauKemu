Tawhirimatea: Maui... It seems I underestimated you. You fought well and you have shown me that you are a true warrior. For your perseverance, I shall grant you the ability to throw your patu with such skill, that it will always return to you
Maui: Thank you Tawhirimatea.  I am most grateful for your gift as it will allow me to defeat Tamanui-te-ra from a distance too
