Tama-nui-te-ra: Hey!  Who are you?  And why have you come here!
Maui: I am Maui, and I have come here to ask you to slow down.  If you do no not comply,  I will be forced to make you!
Tama-nui-te-ra: Bahahaha! I will do no such thing. Besides, you couldn't "make" me do anything.  I am Tama-nui-te-ra!
Maui: Arrrrrgh! I guess it's the hard way then!
