Boss Level	Tama-nui-te-ra (Tamanuitera) is the God and personification of the sun

BEFORE LEVELS CLEARED  
        Tama-nui-te-ra 	“Hey!  Who are you?  And why have you come here!”
Maui	“ I am Maui, and I have come here to ask you to slow down.  If you do no not comply,  I will be forced to make you!”
Tama-nui-te-ra 	“Bahahaha… I will do no such thing.  Besides,  you couldn’t ‘make’ me do anything.  I am Tama-nui-te-ra!”
Tama-nui-te-ra ascends to the sky.  Laughing at Maui as if mocking him.  Then proceeds to dispense his minions to kill him.
Maui	“ Arrrrrgh……  I guess it’s the hard way then!”

CUT SCENE WITH MAUI HOLDING HIM WITH HIS MAGIC HOOKS?

AFTER LEVELS CLEARED 
Maui	“ I’m sorry it had to come to this Tama-nui-te-ra.  But you left me no choice”
Tama-nui-te-ra 	“Please let me go.  If you release me, I promise to move across the sky much slower and give everyone more daylight.  I give you my word”
Maui	“Well, if you keep your promise, and my people are happy…..you will never see me again”.
Tama-nui-te-ra 	“I promise”
