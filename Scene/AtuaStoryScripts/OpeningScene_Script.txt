Opening script with Chief:
Chief 	“Ah Maui, I’m so glad you came.  I have a very important job for you.”

Maui	“ I came as fast as I could my chief.  What do you need me to do? “
 
Chief	“I need you to find a way to slow Tama-nui-te-ra down, so our people can have more daylight to get all their mahi done”. 

Maui	“Yes, I accept the challenge. But he is so powerful.  I am no match for him“.

Chief	“I believe in you Maui, and I know you can defeat him if you can attain the blessing of 
the 5 Atua .  Each of them can grant you a special gift that will help you conquer Te Ra.

Maui	“Tell me where to find the Atua, and I will go and see them now ”

Chief	“If only it were that easy Maui.  The Atua are the protectors of this world and the next. They will not grant you such gifts without first proving to them that you are worthy. Be prepared to be tested my son, as it will not be easy.  Go forth and conquer!”
