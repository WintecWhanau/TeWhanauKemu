Levels 5 & 6	Tawhirimatea – god of weather, including thunder and lightning, wind, clouds and storms

Tawhirimatea	“Maui….It seems I underestimated you.  You fought well and you have shown me that you are a true warrior.  For your perseverance, I shall grant you the ability to throw your patu with such skill, that it will always return to you, whenever you use it”.
Maui	“Thank you Tawhirimatea.  I am most grateful for your gift as it will allow to defeat Tamanui-te-ra from a distance too”.
