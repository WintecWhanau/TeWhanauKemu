Levels 9 & 10	Tumatauenga – god of war, hunting, food cultivation, fishing and cooking

Maui	“There Tumatauenga,  I have beaten your most skilled fighters”.  
Tumatauenga	“Maui….I have seen with my own eyes, that you are indeed a great warrior.  Your journey here can’t have been easy, so the gift I grant you…..is the gift of resilience.  With this gift, you will not be weakened by your enemies so easily.  Surely an advantage when you face Tama-nui-te-ra!”. 
Maui	“Thank you Tumatauenga.  With all the gifts of the Atua combined,  I now feel ready to fight and defeat Tama-nui-te-ra”.
